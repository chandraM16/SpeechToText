## Background of Project

This was a 1 day long project built during my third module at [Newton School](https://www.newtonschool.co/courses/professional-certificate-course-in-full-stack-development) . Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `bootstrap` `react-speech-recognition` and `react-use-clipboard`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was to convert the speech to text. This lead me to spend a few hours on a research spike into learning of third party npm modules like `react-use-clipboard` and `react-speech-recognition`.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Bootstrap, react-speech-recognition , react-use-clipboard, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
